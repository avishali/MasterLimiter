# MasterLimiter — Signal Flow & Component Reference

**Version:** v0.3.0 (beta) · **Audience:** avishali (full mental model of the plugin) · **Maintained by:** Claude (architect)
**Source of truth:** `Source/PluginProcessor.cpp` (`processCore`), `Source/parameters/Parameters.cpp`, and the SDK `melechdsp-hq/shared/mdsp_dsp/`. If code and this doc disagree, the code wins — tell Claude to re-sync.

## 0. Mental model in one paragraph
MasterLimiter is a **mastering maximizer**. Audio comes in, optionally gets soft/hard **clipped**, gets an **input gain** push, is **4× oversampled** (so all limiting math runs at ~192 kHz to avoid aliasing), is split into **two bands at 120 Hz**, each band gets its own **limiter envelope** (a gain-reduction curve), the two bands are blended back toward wideband by the **Color** knob, then a **wideband limiter** catches whatever is left, an **output Ceiling** gain is applied, the signal is **downsampled** back to host rate, and a final **true-peak brickwall** guarantees nothing exceeds the ceiling. In parallel, a **dry copy** is kept delay-aligned for the **bypass cross-fade**, and **LUFS loudness** is measured for optional **auto gain-match**. Everything you see on the meters is tapped at specific points in this chain.

---

## 1. Oversampling & latency (the frame everything runs in)

- **Oversampler:** `juce::dsp::Oversampling<float>`, **4×**, built from **two half-band FIR equiripple stages** (`PluginProcessor.cpp` ~L140–152):
  - **Stage 1** — transition width `0.03`, attenuation `−110 dB`. Tight, because it straddles the audible top octave.
  - **Stage 2** — transition width `0.10`, attenuation `−100 dB`. Wider/cheaper, transparent at the higher rate.
  - Flat to 20 kHz; `setUsingIntegerLatency(true)` so latency is a whole number of samples.
- **Why 4×:** limiting is a nonlinear operation; doing it at 4× pushes the aliasing products far above the audible band so they can be filtered on the way down. (Known limit: at 4× some limiter harmonics still fold back — see §8.)
- **Total plugin latency** = `2 × max lookahead` + oversampler latency + FinalCeiling (lookahead 64 + its detector). The reported latency is fixed at the 6 ms maximum lookahead so DEV tuning does not force host PDC changes.
- **Lookahead** has two DEV-tunable active windows, both defaulting to 5 ms: `dev_lookahead_band_ms` drives the per-band delay/envelope window, and `dev_lookahead_wide_ms` drives the wideband delay/envelope window. Both sweep 0.00…6.00 ms in 0.01 ms steps; 0.00 ms maps internally to the one-oversampled-sample minimum so the delay and envelope window stay aligned. The wet path is padded by the unused slack so total latency stays constant.

## 2. Full signal flow, in order

Each numbered step is what actually happens to a block in `processCore`. Steps **2.1–2.5** run at host rate; **2.6–2.14** run inside the 4× oversampled block; **2.15+** are back at host rate.

**2.1 — I/O Input gain & trim.** `applyIoInputGain()` applies the I/O Input L/R (with optional link). This is your calibration trim before anything else.

**2.2 — Dry capture (delay-aligned).** A copy of the (post-input-trim) signal is pushed through `dryDelay_` (a delay line set to the plugin's total latency) into `dryScratch_`. This keeps the dry signal sample-aligned with the processed signal so the **Bypass cross-fade** (2.17) is phase-correct.

**2.3 — Input metering tap.** Input **peak**, **RMS** (smoothed mean-square), and **true-peak** (4× ISP) for L/R are measured here and published to atomics for the meters. Max-true-peak holds are latched.

**2.4 — Loudness reference.** `loudnessRef_` measures the dry input LUFS (used for the learn reference and dry compensation).

**2.5 — Ceiling-mode latency check.** SP↔TP mode switches keep latency fixed (no re-report glitch).

> If the **Limiter Active** switch is OFF, the chain skips to 2.15 with the dry signal copied through. Everything below is inside `if (limiterActive_)`.

**2.6 — Upsample 4×.** `processSamplesUp` → `osBlock` at 4× rate, `osN` samples.

**2.7 — Clipper (optional, pre-limiter).** Gated by **Clipper Active**. Per sample: multiply by **drive** (`clipper_drive_db`, applied as a *boost into* the clipper), then:
  - **Hard** (`mode 0`): `y = sign(x)` when `|x| > 1`.
  - **Soft** (`mode 1`): tanh soft-knee above **0.891** (≈ −1 dBFS): `y = sign(x)·(0.891 + 0.109·tanh(over))`. Smooth saturation, asymptotic to ±1.
  Then divide back out by the drive (un-drive) so the clipper adds harmonics/density without net level change. The peak attenuation it caused is metered as **Clip dB**.

**2.8 — Input gain.** `input_gain_db` (0–24 dB), smoothed, multiplied in. **This is the knob that drives gain reduction** (the limiter threshold is fixed at 1.0 — see §3).

**2.9 — 2-band split for detection.** `detectCrossover_` (Linkwitz-Riley, 120 Hz) splits each channel into **low/high**; per-sample band peaks (`peakLow`, `peakHigh`) are collected. `snapToZero()` clears filter state at block end.

**2.10 — Per-band limiter envelopes.** `envelopeLow_.process()` and `envelopeHigh_.process()` turn the band peak streams into **gain coefficients** (`gainLow`, `gainHigh`, each ≤ 1.0). These are *gain computers only* — they output a gain curve, they don't touch audio yet. (Details: §4.3.)

**2.11 — Color / band-link blend.** Per sample, `bandLinkSmoothed_` = `mapBandColorToLink(color)` = `1 − color/100`:
  - **Color 0% → fully linked** (`bl = 1`): both bands take `min(gainLow, gainHigh)` → behaves like a transparent wideband limiter.
  - **Color 100% → independent** (`bl = 0`): each band keeps its own gain → multiband character (the loudness-cap-breaking, low-IMD mode).
  The blend is applied both to the gains and to the audio reconstruction.

**2.12 — Lookahead delay + band gain application.** The audio is delayed by `lookahead_` using the active `dev_lookahead_band_ms` window (so the gain curve, computed from the *future* peak, lands *before* the peak arrives — that's the lookahead attack). `applyCrossover_` re-splits the delayed audio and applies `gainLow`/`gainHigh`, blended by `bl` against the un-split delayed signal → `bandLimitedBuf_`.

**2.13 — Wideband limiter.** The band-limited signal is peak-detected again (or M/S-encoded if **Stereo Mode = M/S**) and run through `envelope_` (and `envelope_R_` when stereo unlinked). **Stereo Link / M/S Link** (%) blends L/R gain toward `min(L,R)`; at ≥99.95% it takes a single-envelope fast path. This is the safety stage that catches anything the per-band stage let through.

**2.14 — Wideband lookahead + Ceiling + GR tap.** Audio is delayed by `lookaheadWide_` using the active `dev_lookahead_wide_ms` window, multiplied by the wideband gain and by **`ceilingLin`** (the output ceiling gain). In M/S mode a per-sample decoded-peak safety clamp guarantees the reconstructed L/R never exceeds threshold. The **total gain reduction** (`min(bandGain × wideGain)` over the block, L/R) is published to `currentGrDb_/LDb_/RDb_` and the max-since-reset is latched — **this is the GR the meters and the new history graph read.** `lookaheadPad_` then adds `(max−band) + (max−wide)` samples of wet-path delay before downsampling so the active windows remain latency-constant.

**2.15 — Downsample.** `processSamplesDown` returns to host rate.

**2.16 — Final ceiling brickwall.** `finalCeiling_.process()` — a residual **true-peak (or sample-peak) limiter** that catches inter-sample peaks created by downsampling, so the output true-peak equals the ceiling. (Details: §4.4.)

**2.17 — Loudness tracking, auto gain-match, bypass cross-fade.**
  - `loudnessTrack_` measures the processed output LUFS; `updateCompensationGainDb` derives a smoothed (~1 s) gain so output LUFS matches the learned reference (±12 dB clamp). Same applied to the dry path.
  - **Bypass cross-fade:** `bypassFade_` blends live↔dry sample-by-sample (click-free bypass), using the delay-aligned dry copy from 2.2.

**2.18 — I/O Output gain + output metering.** `applyIoOutputGain()`, then output peak/RMS/true-peak are measured and published.

---

## 3. The Ceiling model (Ozone-style decouple) — important
- The **limiter threshold is fixed at 1.0** (sample-peak) / **0.965** (true-peak). It does **not** move with the Ceiling knob.
- **Ceiling = an output gain** applied *after* limiting (`ceilingLin`, step 2.14), with the FinalCeiling brickwall guaranteeing it.
- Consequence: **gain reduction responds only to Input Gain, not to Ceiling.** Lowering the ceiling lowers output level without changing how hard the limiter works. `ceiling_db` default **0.0**.
- `MDSP_BAND_HEADROOM_DB = 0` (the old per-band pre-shave is removed).

---

## 4. Component deep-dives (plain-language)

### 4.1 Crossover (`detectCrossover_` / `applyCrossover_`)
`juce::dsp::LinkwitzRileyFilter`, 120 Hz, complementary low/high that sum back to flat. **Two instances on purpose:** one drives *detection* (measuring band peaks), the other drives *application* (splitting the delayed audio to apply gain) — separating them avoids state bleed between the measure and apply paths. `snapToZero()` flushes filter state at block boundaries.

### 4.2 LookaheadDelay (`lookahead_`, `lookaheadWide_`, `lookaheadPad_`, plus `dryDelay_`)
Simple per-channel circular buffers. `pushPop()` writes the new sample and returns the one from `delaySamples` ago — RT-safe, no allocation. `lookahead_` and `lookaheadWide_` make each gain curve line up with its active envelope window; `lookaheadPad_` absorbs the unused max-window slack so reported latency never changes while sweeping DEV lookahead.

### 4.3 LimiterEnvelope (the heart — gain computer)
Input = peak stream, output = gain coefficient stream (≤1). No audio delay here; the caller does the delaying.
- **Attack** = a **half-cosine ramp** (`attackTable_`, `0.5·(1−cos(π·k/n))`) applied across the lookahead window so gain eases down *into* each peak. The temporary **DEV Attack** knob now overrides Character-derived attack for all envelopes while tuning:
  - **DEV Attack** = `dev_attack_ms`, clamped per envelope to `1..active lookahead samples` so it can never exceed the LA Band/LA Wide window.
  - With the DEV override removed/disabled, attack length returns to **Character**:
  - **Clean** ≈ 3 ms · **Tight** ≈ 1 ms · **Aggressive** ≈ 0.3 ms.
- **Release — two selectable engines** (chosen by the DEV Release Engine toggle, §6):
  - **AdaptiveSigma (legacy):** two cascaded one-pole smoothers whose time-constant is blended between a *fast* and *slow* value by **`sigma`** (an estimate of how *sustained* the limiting is). Asymmetric: sigma rises fast (attack), decays slow. Per-mode timing table:

    | Auto Release mode | fast ms | slow ms | sigma ms |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Transparent** | 80 | 1200 | 250 |
    | **Balanced** | 50 | 600 | 200 |
    | **Reactive** | 20 | 250 | 150 |

    The audible downside: the *rate-switching itself* can be heard. This is what we're moving away from.
  - **LookaheadFollower (new, current best):** removes rate-switching. Recovery is **gated by the minimum gain visible within the lookahead window** (a sliding-window minimum) so the gain only recovers in genuine gaps — *program-dependence comes from the signal, not a guessed time constant*. The recovery slope is a **fixed-time N-pole cascade** (2–4 poles), giving the same smooth S-curve every release. Time = `dev_la_release_ms` (normalized per pole so pole-count changes smoothness, not speed).

### 4.4 FinalCeilingLimiter
A small, fixed brickwall after downsampling. 64-sample lookahead + its own 4× true-peak detector. In **TruePeak** mode it oversamples internally to catch inter-sample peaks; in **SamplePeak** mode it just clamps samples. Hardwired Aggressive attack, 100 ms release. Its job is only to mop up residual overshoot so output true-peak = ceiling.

### 4.5 TruePeakDetector (metering)
4× oversampled absolute-max estimate of inter-sample peak. Four instances (IN L/R, OUT L/R) feed the true-peak readouts; overs above 0 dBFS render red with a "+".

### 4.6 Loudness (`loudnessRef_`, `loudnessTrack_`, `LoudnessAnalyzer`)
ITU/EBU-style LUFS: K-weighting (high-shelf @1681.97 Hz +4 dB, then high-pass @38.13 Hz), `LUFS = −0.691 + 10·log10(meanSquare)`. Windows: Momentary 0.4 s, **Short-term 3 s** (used for gain-match), Integrated from reset. **Auto gain-match:** captures a learned reference LUFS, then nudges a smoothed (~1 s) compensation gain so processed LUFS tracks the reference (±12 dB) — lets you A/B at matched loudness.

## 6. DEV controls (TEMPORARY — remove before 0.4)
Live, RT-safe tuning knobs now live in the separate header **DEV** window, grouped by operating section. They drive release/lookahead/attack voicing experiments; defaults reproduce the baked constants where applicable. The main view intentionally has no inline DEV strip.

| Window section | Controls |
|---|---|
| ATTACK | `dev_attack_ms` |
| LOOKAHEAD | `dev_lookahead_band_ms`, `dev_lookahead_wide_ms` |
| RELEASE · Engine | `dev_release_engine` |
| RELEASE · Lookahead engine | `dev_la_release_ms`, `dev_la_release_poles` |
| RELEASE · Adaptive engine | `dev_sigma_attack_ms`, `dev_sigma_decay_scale` |
| RELEASE · Band scaling | `dev_low_band_release_scale`, `dev_high_band_release_scale` |
| RELEASE · Manual | `release_sustain_ratio` |

| DEV control | ID | Range | Default | Drives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Release Engine** | `dev_release_engine` | Adaptive / Lookahead | **Adaptive** | Chooses §4.3 engine | A/B switch. **Lookahead is the current winner.** |
| **LA Release** | `dev_la_release_ms` | 5…400 ms (skewed low) | 80 | LookaheadFollower recovery time | The knob to sweep. Expected sweet spot well under 80 ms. |
| **LA Poles** | `dev_la_release_poles` | 2 / 3 / 4 | 3 | Cascade order = recovery smoothness | Normalized so it changes smoothness, not speed. |
| **Low Release Scale** | `dev_low_band_release_scale` | 0.5…8.0× | 3.0 | Low-band release multiplier | Low band releases slower (default 3×). Applies to *both* engines. |
| **High/Wide Release Scale** | `dev_high_band_release_scale` | 0.5…8.0× | 1.0 | High/wideband release multiplier | Nominal 1×. |
| **Sigma Attack** | `dev_sigma_attack_ms` | 1…50 ms | 5 | AdaptiveSigma: how fast `sigma` rises | Legacy-engine only. |
| **Sigma Decay Scale** | `dev_sigma_decay_scale` | 0.5…8.0× | 1.0 | AdaptiveSigma: how slow `sigma` decays | Legacy-engine only. |
| **LA Band** | `dev_lookahead_band_ms` | 0…6 ms, 0.01 ms step | 5 | Per-band audio delay + low/high envelope window | 0.00 maps to one OS sample; latency stays fixed via wet-path padding. |
| **LA Wide** | `dev_lookahead_wide_ms` | 0…6 ms, 0.01 ms step | 5 | Wideband audio delay + wide envelope window | 0.00 maps to one OS sample; latency stays fixed via wet-path padding. |
| **Attack** | `dev_attack_ms` | 0.05…10 ms | 3 | All limiter envelope attack ramps | Overrides Character; capped by each active lookahead window. |
| **Sustain Ratio** | `release_sustain_ratio` | 1…10 | 4 | Manual-release sustain split | Active only when Release Auto is Off. |

**Plan:** once Attack, LA Band/Wide, LA Release ms, and Poles are chosen by ear, Claude bakes them as constants or promotes any keeper to a real user parameter, then deletes the temporary DEV params for 0.4.

## 7. Metering taps (what's measured where — read this before the history graph)
Most metering is **instantaneous scalar atomics** written by the audio thread and read by the UI at **30 Hz** (`PluginEditor` timer → `MainView::syncMetersFromProcessor`). The history graph additionally drains a lock-free SPSC ring of ~0.5 ms frames (`grDb`, `outDb`, `inDb`, `clipDb`) captured from per-sample GR/clip envelopes and sample values.

| Quantity | Atomic(s) | Tapped at step |
|---|---|---|
| Input peak / RMS / true-peak L/R | `inputPeakLDb_`, `inputRmsLDb_`, `inputTruePeakLDb_`, … | 2.3 |
| Gain reduction (wide / L / R / max) | `currentGrDb_`, `currentGrLDb_`, `currentGrRDb_`, `maxGrSinceResetDb_` | 2.14 |
| Clip reduction | `currentClipDb_`, `maxClipSinceResetDb_` | 2.7 |
| Output peak / RMS / true-peak L/R | `outputPeakLDb_`, `outputRmsLDb_`, `outputTruePeakLDb_`, … | 2.18 |
| Loudness / comp gain | `LoudnessAnalyzer` snapshots, `compGainDb` | 2.4 / 2.17 |

---

## 8. Known discrepancies & backlog (so the doc stays honest)
1. **Multiband true-peak leak:** at Color 100 + TruePeak, output TP can leak to ~−0.4 (over ceiling). Root cause = 4× OS headroom. Grouped with harmonic aliasing in the "OS-quality" slice (raise OS to 8×+ and/or proper ISP control).
2. **Color intermediate (0<x<100):** low end dips from phase cancellation between the full-band and allpass-split paths; endpoints (0/100) are clean. Fix = linear-phase complementary crossover (adds latency).
3. **DEV params** are shipping in the beta build — must be removed for 0.4.
4. **Metering history depth** — history graph storage is fixed at 65536 frames for the 30 s max view; extend only if a future UI window needs more.
